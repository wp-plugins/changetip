Get appreciated for great content and monetize in new ways. Include a tip.me button on each article to allow readers to tip you.

== Description ==

www.changetip.com - the leading micropayment infrastructure for the web.

Now your readers can directly show their appreciation and how they value your content by sending tips.

Get appreciated (and paid) for great content.

1. Get tipped for your content when a reader clicks the social tip.me button.
  - Readers can leave any amount or even send you a virtual coffee.

2. Engage with readers in comments. readers can send you tips in comments, tip each other, and you can even reward users via ChangeTip in comment responses.
  - "Great post, have a coffee on me @ChangeTip", "@ChangeTip send $1 for this article” or "Love this!!! 300 bits @ChangeTip".

3. Publishers with multiple authors may allow individual authors to receive tips too.

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin dashboard, click "Plugins" -> "Add New" and search for "changetip"

2. Remember to "Activate" the plugin after installation (often reactivation is automatic when upgrading)

3. Also if upgrading, remember to reconnect any ChangeTip accounts you currently have connected. This tells changetip.com that you have the latest plugin installed and that changetip.com can use the latest features (such as upgrades to the tip button) for your blog.

4. Find the ChangeTip option in the left navigation bar, and select Connect. 
- If you only need to connect one account,  simply login to a your ChangeTip account with the same browser (preferably in another browser tab or window), then return to the WordPress ChangeTip Settings section and click "Connect ChangeTip Account", and follow the popover instructions.
- If you’d like to allow other authors to connect their accounts, instruct them to connect using the same method described above. Note: The author will only have access to ChangeTip > Connect and will not have access to Settings unless they have admin access to WordPress.

5. After you've connected all your accounts, the plugin will attempt to automatically associate them with other authors of your blog by username. To manage this yourself, navigate to users in WordPress, select a user and scroll down to the section titled "ChangeTip Account". From there you may select the ChangeTip account you wish to associate with this particular user.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Do I need an account on Changetip.com in order to use this plugin?
Yes, you'll need to create an account (login via Facebook, Twitter, Google, Reddit, etc) at www.changetip.com, then connect your account to changetip.com (see step 3 in the installation instructions.)  This way, when someone tips you, your account will receive those tips which you can withdrawal, spend, or tip others!

2. Do commenters or readers who want to leave me a tip need to have an account at changetip.com?
Not at first.  While leaving you a tip, the plugin will open a popover window to allow the tipper to confirm the amount they are leaving. This flow will ask them to login/create an account at www.changetip.com if they don't already have one.
