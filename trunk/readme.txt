A Love Button for the Internet
When a Like isn't enough, mention @changetip and we will send a tip with Bitcoin to the blog author.

== Description ==

Install this plugin and connect your wordpress blog with changetip.com and now your readers can send you tips with ease!

Get tipped for your content when a user clicks the social tip.me share button or leaves you a comment, such as "Great post, here $1 @changetip", "High Five @changetip" or "Love this!!! 300 bits @changetip".

The plugin will present the reader with a pop over changetip.com page of the blog author, where the user can leave a tip for the user.

Changetip is live on twitter, reddit, google+, youtube and other social sites and now on your Wordpress blog :)

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin dashboard, click "Plugins" -> "Add New" and search for "changetip"

2. Remember to "Activate" the plugin after installation

3. Now under Settings->ChangeTip you can connect the plugin to any number of Changetip.com accounts for single or multi-author support. Simply log into a ChangeTip account with the same browser (preferrably in another browser tab or window), then return to the WordPress ChangeTip Settings section and click "Connect ChangeTip Account", next follow the popover instructions.

4. Repeat step 3 for any number of different ChangeTip accounts. After you've connected all your accounts, the plugin will attempt to automatically associate them with other authors of your blog by username. To manage this yourself, simply Click "Users" in your WordPress admin dashboard. Next, select a user, scroll down to the section titled "ChangeTip Account". From there you can select the ChangeTip account you wish to associate with this particular user.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Do I need an account on Changetip.com in order to use this plugin?
Yes, you'll need to create an account (login via Facebook, Twitter, Google, Reddit, etc) at www.changetip.com, then connect your account to changetip.com (see step 3 in the installation instructions.)  This way, when someone tips you, your account will receive those tips, which you can withdrawal, spend or tip others!

2. Do commenters or readers who want to leave me a tip need to have an account at changetip.com?
Not at first.  While leaving you a tip, the plugin will open a popover window to allow the tipper to confirm the amount they are leaving. This flow will ask them to login/create an account at www.changetip.com if they don't already have one.
