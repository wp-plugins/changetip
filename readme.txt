A Love Button for the Internet
When a Like isn't enough, mention @changetip and we will send a tip with Bitcoin to the blog author.

== Description ==

www.changetip.com - the leading micropayment infrastructure for the web.

Now your readers can directly show their appreciation and how they value your content by sending tips.

Install this plugin and connect your wordpress blog with changetip.com to give your readers the option to micro pay you.

1. Get tipped for your content when a reader clicks the social tip.me button.
  - Readers can leave any amount and send you comments via the tip button.

2. Readers familiar with ChangeTip may also choose to leave you a tip in the comment section of your blog.
  - "Great post, here $1 @changetip", "High Five @changetip" or "Love this!!! 300 bits @changetip".

3. Publishers with multiple authors can connect and receive tip buttons for all their staff!

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin dashboard, click "Plugins" -> "Add New" and search for "changetip"

2. Remember to "Activate" the plugin after installation (often reactivation is automatic when upgrading)

3. Also if upgrading, remember to reconnect any changetip accounts you currently have connected. This tells changetip.com that you have the latest plugin installed and that changetip.com can use the latest features (such as the tip button upgrade) for your blog.

4. Under Settings->ChangeTip you can connect the plugin to any number of Changetip.com accounts for single or multi-author support. Simply log into a ChangeTip account with the same browser (preferrably in another browser tab or window), then return to the WordPress ChangeTip Settings section and click "Connect ChangeTip Account", next follow the popover instructions.

5. Repeat step 3 for any number of different ChangeTip accounts. After you've connected all your accounts, the plugin will attempt to automatically associate them with other authors of your blog by username. To manage this yourself, simply Click "Users" in your WordPress admin dashboard. Next, select a user, scroll down to the section titled "ChangeTip Account". From there you can select the ChangeTip account you wish to associate with this particular user.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Do I need an account on Changetip.com in order to use this plugin?
Yes, you'll need to create an account (login via Facebook, Twitter, Google, Reddit, etc) at www.changetip.com, then connect your account to changetip.com (see step 3 in the installation instructions.)  This way, when someone tips you, your account will receive those tips, which you can withdrawal, spend or tip others!

2. Do commenters or readers who want to leave me a tip need to have an account at changetip.com?
Not at first.  While leaving you a tip, the plugin will open a popover window to allow the tipper to confirm the amount they are leaving. This flow will ask them to login/create an account at www.changetip.com if they don't already have one.
